# Easy-enter-ids (edit.py)
To get this to work. drag edit.py into your sniper folder and leave it.
Open edit.py.
Use.

After opening, it will scan your clipboard until it finds a roblox catalog link, then it open the sniper with that link.

Just recopy the link to open it again.

Every line is explained, so you cant say it's a cookie logger

I would appreciate a star so people dont say it's a cookie logger

Common errors: 

Closes and opens instantly. Fix: Open the folder in cmd, then do "python edit.py"

If you get a no module error, do "pip install (insert-module)

If you dont have a log.json automatically, make one so it works.

Note: Opening main.py with log.py is broken right now. Logs still work fine
