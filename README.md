# Easy-enter-ids
To get this to work. drag edit.py into your sniper folder and leave it.
open a command prompt with the cmd path being in your sniper folder. I recommend using terminal from the microsoft store to make it easier.
the command to edit ids is "edit.py (yourid)" and it changes your id and opens main.py
